          <p>I've almost always had a PC to toy with since i'm young. </p>
          <p>Many times I've made them crash while trying things and figeting with them.</p>
          <p>I acquired a lot of knowlegde through trials and errors but now I can solve a lot of problems, complicated or not and I'm offen called to help by my relatives.</p>
          </br>
          <p>It took me a while to finaly touch some code but when I did I was sure it was for me, I realy like how you are only limited to your imagination and that ther's always new things to learn</p>
          </br>
          <p>I've had some coding lessons, I understand the basics and I have coded a few things so I'm ready for September!</p>
          <p>I'm not a pro and that's why i'm glad I have the chance to participate to the java@fin programm :D</p>
